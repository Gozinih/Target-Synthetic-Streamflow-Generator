# Target Synthetic Streamflow Generator

This repository provides a Python-based framework to generate **target synthetic streamflow scenarios**, targeting monthly magnitude, variability, and seasonality, while ensuring feasibility based on historical data.

The project is a faithful translation and improvement of an original MATLAB implementation, helped by ChatGPT, designed to support water resources planning under different climate or policy change scenarios.

The methodology of **Nowak et al. (2010)** is used for disaggregation and **Kirsch et al. (2013)** for synthetic flow generation. 
See [📚 References](#-references) for full citations.

## 📦 Key Features

- Generate synthetic streamflow scenarios, targeting monthly magnitude (mean), variation (standard deviation), and seasonality.
- Remove fully infeasible scenarios and adjust partially infeasible ones, based on boundary scenarios.
- Optimize monthly forcing values to match target changes.
- Convert optimized monthly flows into daily time series (with leap year correction).
- Supports **local** (resampling) and **non-local** (optimization) stations.
- Resampling for local locations would be from historical data with the same recorded sequence.
- Built-in visualization tools to plot exposure space, flow duration curves, and monthly time series.
- Includes example data for a 14-inflow-location case study to test and validate the generator.

## 💻 **Recommended Development Environment**:  
- The codebase was developed and tested using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python 3.11](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11-blue) interpreter.
- The **H5Web** extension is useful for exploring `.h5` output files directly within VS Code.

## 🧠 Workflow Overview

1. **Input Configuration**  
   - Set your simulation parameters and file paths in `InputData.txt`.
   - `RecordedData.xlsx`: Daily flow data and `isLocal` flags (2 sheets)
   - `Mean_Seasonality.xlsx`: Seasonal mean change matrix [locations × 12]
   - `SD_Seasonality.xlsx`: Seasonal SD change matrix [locations × 12]
   - *(Optional)* `RandomYearMatrix.xlsx`: Year sampling matrix (auto-generated if missing)

2. **Execution**  
   Run the full process via:
   Run.bat or Run.py

4. **Outputs**  
   Depending on the flags, the script will produce:
   - Daily (cms) CSV files (`/DailyTimeseriesCSVFiles`)
   - Monthly (cms) CSV files (`/MonthlyTimeseriesCSVFiles`)
   - HDF5 files with all results (`/OutputData`)
   - Saved HDF5 input for reproducibility (`/InputData`)
  💡 To browse `.h5` files easily in VS Code, install the **H5Web** extension from the Extensions Marketplace.

## 📊 Scenario Generation Tools (GeneratorCodes/)

The process includes:
- Main code to upload data and run the generator (`a1`)
- Random year matrix generation (`a2`)
- Boundary space generation (`a3`, `a4`, `a5`, `a6`)
- Stochastic streamflow generator  (`a4`) **Kirsch et al. (2013)**
- Mean and SD calculator functions (`a5`, `a6`)
- Feasibility checks and adjustments (`a7`, `a8`, `a9`)
- Inverse optimization + disaggregation (`a10` to `a16`)
- Disaggregation from monthly to daily (`a17`) **Nowak et al. (2010)**

Each script is modular, documented, and uses Numba-accelerated routines for performance.

## 📈 Visualization Tools (`PlottingCodes/`)

The repository includes optional plotting scripts for scenario evaluation:

- **c1_ExposureSpacePlot.py**  
  Visualizes the exposure space (mean and SD changes) for any two selected locations across all months and scenarios. Useful for checking feasibility and alignment with target zones.

- **c2_FlowDurationCurve.py**  
  Plots monthly Flow Duration Curves (FDCs) comparing synthetic scenarios against historical flow records, for 4 selected locations. Useful for validating statistical flow distributions.

- **c3_TimeSeries_MonthlyFlow.py**  
  Displays time series plots of monthly flow for 4 selected locations. Overlays recorded flow data with the full synthetic min–max envelope.

Each plotting tool reads `.h5` scenario outputs from `/Scenarios/OutputData` and is customizable to focus on different locations.
